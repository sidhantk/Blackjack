A simulated Blackjack game. It consists of a central game server which creates the game, including dealing cards, etc. The client players (all programmed in different languages) all connect once the server starts, and join the game. The server proceeds to carry out the game, asking the player clients their moves. At the end, statistics are compiled and printed. These stats include average time each player took to make a move and analyze the game board, and each player's wins/losses/busts/draws. This can be used to benchmark the coding, runtime, and AI performance of each language.
